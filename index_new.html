              <p>In Recreating the Past, we studied computational art from past decades and recreated these works with contemporary techniques to gain aesthetic, analytical, and technical knowledge.</p>
              
              <p>Each classroom session investigated a different set of artists that created work with software, either through code or algorithmic processes. We then recreated their artworks from scratch, discussing their approaches, tools, and poetic underpinnings, investigating what modern tools and approaches might offer to historic works. We also looked at what the artwork taught us about algorithmic approaches and conceptual explorations. The class focused on the building blocks of media art and generative design practice: algorithmic composition, typography, imaging, computer vision, audio analysis/synthesis, and interaction design.</p>

              <p>An early pioneer of computer-generated art, Hungarian Vera Molnár (1924–2023) insisted that computers were tools, not partners. Trained in traditional painting and art history, she turned to strict geometric abstraction in the late 1940s, exploring how simple lines, grids, and squares could be systematically transformed. Before she had access to a computer, Molnár invented what she called her machine imaginaire—an "imaginary machine" of rules and algorithms carried out by hand on paper.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-column">
              <p>In 1968, Molnár gained access to a computer in a Sorbonne research lab and taught herself Fortran. She began to draw with plotters, translating her imagined procedures into actual code. Throughout her career she embraced chance and "small doses of disorder," deliberately introducing a "1% disorder" factor to influence her work. These self-imposed constraints produced quietly radical works that linked human intuition with algorithmic logic.</p>

              <p>John Whitney (1917–1995) was an American animator, composer, and inventor widely regarded as a father of computer animation. Raised in Pasadena and trained in music at Pomona College and in Paris, he began making abstract films in the 1940s with his brother James. Using repurposed World War II anti-aircraft equipment, he built a mechanical analog computer that let him choreograph complex visual motion frame by frame.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-column">
              <p>Whitney's mature work fused musical structure with what he called "visual harmony." <em>MATRIX III</em> (1972) distills these ideas into a hypnotic study of triangles, squares, and hexagons whose motion follows invisible Lissajous paths across the frame. Set to Terry Riley's <em>Rainbow in Curved Air</em>, the film exemplifies Whitney's belief that computer-generated motion could act as a kind of visual music, uniting time, space, and perception.</p>

              <p>Bridget Riley (b. 1931, London) is a leading figure in Op Art, renowned for paintings that make flat surfaces seem to pulse, tilt, or shimmer. Trained at Goldsmiths and the Royal College of Art, she shifted in the late 1950s from Post-Impressionist, figurative work to a stripped-down language of lines, grids, and curves, shaped by her study of Georges Seurat and modernist abstraction. Early black-and-white works like Movement in Squares (1961) turned perception itself into her subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-column">
              <p>Her reputation crystallized with MoMA's 1965 exhibition The Responsive Eye, where Riley's painting Current became an icon of Op Art. She soon introduced color, developing stripe and curve compositions that use finely tuned chromatic contrasts to suggest rhythm, space, and movement without depicting objects. Over seven decades, working between London, Cornwall, and France, Riley has remained focused on how color and form act on the eye, insisting that the viewer completes the work.</p>
